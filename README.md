# Exit_Survey
An analysis of DETE and TAFE surveys to find factors leading to dissatisfaction in teachers 

In this project we will be analyzing exit survey from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment]( https://qed.qld.gov.au/)(DETE) and the [Technical and Further Education]( https://tafeqld.edu.au/)(TAFE). 

The data for the DETE exit surveys can be found [here]( https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey), unfortunately the data for the TAFE exit survey data is no longer available online. 

In this project, we will attempt to answer the following questions: 
- Are employees who worked for the DOE for a short period of time resigning due dissatisfaction, why do long standing employees resign?
- Do employee age play as a factor in resigning due to dissatisfaction
